# WIA2007 Group Project
Mobile App Development Assignment
This project is an Android app that enables users to book a table at a restaurant with ease. Developed using Android Studio, the app provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to browse through restaurants, view available tables and menu, then make reservations. The booking process is straightforward, and users receive confirmation of their reservation via notification. The app makes dining out hassle-free and ensures a seamless experience for both users and restaurants.

Additionally, the app also includes an admin portal that allows restaurant owners to manage their business operations efficiently. From the admin site, restaurant owners can view and manage table bookings, add new tables or check table availability, and update the menu items. This functionality enables restaurant owners to stay on top of their business and provide a seamless dining experience for their customers. Overall, the table booking app developed using Android Studio simplifies the booking process for users and helps restaurant owners manage their operations effectively.
